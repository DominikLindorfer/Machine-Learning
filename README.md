# Exploring NEAT
This repository documents my exploration with the NEAT AI (NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies) by playing the game flappy bird, using the python NEAT module. The original fork has been from ["TechWithTim"'s repository](https://github.com/techwithtim/NEAT-Flappy-Bird).

Stanley's seminal Paper [*Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies (2002)*](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) serves as a very good starting point to get familiar with the methodolgy of NEAT and the documentation of NEAT-Python can be found [here](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
